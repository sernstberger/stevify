          Expertise
          I am a Front-End Developer with 10 years of professional experience. I have worked with large enterprise clients like Interactive Intelligence and ExactTarget, start-ups with one employee, and everything in between. I enjoy solving problems and creating beautiful interfaces that are easy to use on any device.
